### Data serialization framework (RPC)

*Protocol Buffers* (proto2, proto3): Google
- messages are key-value pairs
- define, in a file `.proto`, the message structure
- the message is then compiled in a programming language of choice
- compact format
- used by gRPC (gRPC+protobuf faster than Rest+JSON)

*Thrift*: Facebook then Apache
- we define a message structure then we compile it into an object
- more languages available than *Protocol Buffers* (?)
*Avro*: Apache
- schema defined in JSON, dynamic, not compiled


#### API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software and applications. An API specifies how software components should interact, allowing for communication between different systems and enabling the creation of applications that access data and services of other programs. For example, an API for a weather website may allow developers to retrieve the current weather conditions or forecast for a specific location by making requests to the API and receiving data in response

#### REST

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular software architectural style for building scalable web services. It is based on a client-server model and leverages HTTP, the standard web protocol, to make requests and receive responses. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources represented as URIs, and return responses in a format such as JSON or XML. REST is known for its simplicity, scalability, and performance, and is widely used for building modern web-based APIs.

#### REST API

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of API that conforms to the architectural constraints of REST and uses HTTP requests to manipulate data. REST APIs allow for the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of resources, which are typically represented as URIs. In a REST API, the client sends an HTTP request to the server to access or modify a resource, and the server returns a response in a standardized format, such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are widely used for building modern, scalable web services and are a flexible, easy-to-use alternative to SOAP APIs.

#### RESTful API

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of web API that conforms to the architectural constraints of REST (Representational State Transfer) and uses HTTP methods to interact with resources. A RESTful API is structured around the concepts of resources, which are represented as URIs, and the actions that can be performed on those resources, such as retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting data. The client sends an HTTP request to the server to access or modify a resource, and the server returns a response in a standardized format, such as JSON or XML. RESTful APIs are commonly used for building modern, scalable web services, and are known for their ease of use, flexibility, and performance.

#### Data exchange using REST APIs

*Representational state transfer* - Restful API contains:
- a resource description URI
- HTTP methods
- MIME types: JSON, XML, but also data structure (pages, sorting, ...) – can take considerable implementation effort

#### RPC API vs JSON HTTP API

RPC use cases:
- micro-services (RPC is low latency, high debit, so low network volume)
- streaming (real-time)
Disadvantages:
- cannot call services directly via HTTP (=browser)
- binary format, so not human readable

### Using a message broker - "courtier de messages"

*Publish & subscribe platforms*

Intermediary between providers and receivers (subscribers)
- exchange is simplified (providers and receivers are independent)
- allows asynchronous communication
Compared to RPC:
- no direct communication
- sometimes needs heavy architecture (Kafka vs. gRPC)
*message queue*: each message read once, or pub/sub – only subscribers are read

#### Example of message agent

- data streams
- guarantees receiving the message in the same order
- partitioning & replication
- objective: low latency, high debit

### Kafka

- data streams with low latency
- guarantees receiving the message in the same order (in the same partition)
- partitioning and replication
- objective: low latency, high debit

*Main role*: publish-subscribe system used as a “distributed commit/message log”
- activity streams, real-time data pipelines (Twitter)
- real-time event processing (Netflix)
- log delivery (Spotify)
- telemetry data (Mozilla)

*Actors*:
- data producers write data to brokers
- consumers read data from brokers distributed
*Data*:
- data is stored in topics
- each topic is split into partitions, which are replicated
- each partition is an ordered sequence of messages
- messages take the form of key-value pairs

*Real-time messaging*: clients assign offsets (what has been read) to topics and wait for new
messages to arrive

*Topics*:
- a topic is composed of partitions
- partition: ordered and immutable sequence of messages
- continually appended to
- number of partitions = consumer parallelism

*Replication*: back-ups of partitions
- only to prevent data loss
- never read from, never written to
- data loss when numReplicas − 1 are lost

### Principles of key-value stores

Reminder on principle of NoSQL:
trade availability for speed and scale
Simple data models are generally faster
Simplest data model – key-value:
key: short byte sequence (most often, integer)
value: long(er) byte sequence (e.g., string)
No query language – two main operations:
PUT(k,v)
GET(k)

#### Key-value data models

Simplest approach:
one value par key
But more complex approaches can exist:
organize so that key-value pairs belong to collections, tables or tables
multiple values per key
one key can be a list of attributes, where each attribute has a value

### ReDiS - REmote DIctionary Server (2009)

*Key*:
- printable ASCII
*Value*:
- strings (primitive type)
- hashes
- lists
- sets
- sorted sets

#### System Architecture

*Redis Instance*:
- main memory database
- single-threaded event loop
*VM architecture*:
- organized in values, not pages
*Data Persistence*
- periodic dump in background
- append only file (on every write, append change to log file)

#### Redis vs. CAP Theorem

*Transactions*: commands serialized and executed sequentially, all commands
or no commands are processed, keys must specified in transactions

*Replication*: organized as a tree, data redundancy, master is unaware of slaves (only
the master needs to accept the write)

Consistency, Availability:
- writes via single master, any node reads, eventual consistency
Consistency, Partitioning:
- on failure: inhibit writes
Partitioning, Availability:
- on failure: elect new master

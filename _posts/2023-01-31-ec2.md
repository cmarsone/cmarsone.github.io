## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2):
- Provides *virtual machines* - refered to as EC2 instances - in the cloud
- Fives you full control over the guest operating system (Windows or Linux) on each instance

You can launch instances of any size into and Availability Zone anywhere in the world
- Launch instance from *Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)*
- Launch instances with a few clicks or a line of code, and they are ready in minutes

You can control traffic to and from instances

### Creating a new AMI:

1. Launch an instance
2. Connect to the instance and manually modify it or run a script that modifies the instance e.g. upgrade
3. Capture as a new AMI
4. Copy the AMI to any other Regions where you want to use it

### Select an instance type

The instance type that you choose determines –
• Memory (RAM)
• Processing power (CPU)
• Disk space and disk type (Storage)
• Network performance

Instance type categories –
• General purpose
• Compute optimized
• Memory optimized
• Storage optimized
• Accelerated computing

Instance type naming by *family*, *generation* and *size*. Example: *t3.large*

*Networking features*: bandwidth, enhanced networking types

### Specify network settings

Identify the *VPC* and optionally the *subnet* and automatically assign a *public IP address* and make it internet-accessible

### Attach IAM role (optional):

Will software on the EC2 instance need to interact with other AWS
services? If yes, attach an appropriate *IAM Role*

An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is attached
to an EC2 instance is kept in an *instance profile*.

### User data script (optional)

Optionally specify a user data script at instance launch. Use user data scripts to customize the runtime environment of your instance. *Script runs the first time the instance starts*

### Specify storage

- Configure the *root volume* where the guest O.S. is installed
- Attach *additional storage volumes* (optional)
- Need to specify the *size*, *volume type*, *encryption*, *free* (release the volume)

### Amazon EC2 storage options

• *Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)* –
  • *Durable*, block-level storage volumes. (formatage
  • You can stop the instance and start it again, and the data will still be there.
  
• *Amazon EC2 Instance Store* –
  • *Ephemeral* storage is provided on disks that are attached to the host computer where the EC2 instance is running.
  • *If the instance stops, data stored here is deleted*.

• Other options for storage (not for the root volume) –
  • Mount an *Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)* file system.
  • Connect to *Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)*

### Add tags

A *tag* is a label that you can assign to an AWS resource. It consists of a key and an optional value. (metadata)

### Security group settings

A *security group* is a *set of firewall rules* that control
traffic to the instance. It exists outside of the instance's guest OS.

Create *rules* that specify the *source* (IP address) and which *ports* (protocol) that network communications can use

### Identify or create the key pair

At instance launch, you specify an existing key pair or create a new key pair.
A *key pair* consists of –
• A *public key* that AWS stores.
• A *private key* file that you store.
It enables secure connections to the instance.

### Amazon EC2 lifecycle

### Consider using an Elastic IP address

*Rebooting* an instance will not change any IP addresses or DNS hostnames.
When an instance is stopped and then
started again –
• The public IPv4 address and external DNS
hostname will change.
• The private IPv4 address and internal DNS
hostname do not change.

If you require a persistent public IP
address – Associate an Elastic IP address with the
instance.

Elastic IP address characteristics –
• Can be associated with instances in the
Region as needed.
• Remains allocated to your account until you
choose to release it.

*EC2 Instance metadata* is data about your EC2 instance.

Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instances
• Provides near-real-time metrics
• Provides charts in the Amazon EC2 console Monitoring
tab that you can view
• Maintains 15 months of historical data

Key takeaways:

• Amazon EC2 enables you to run Windows and Linux
virtual machines in the cloud.
• You launch EC2 instances from an AMI template
into a VPC in your account.
• You can choose from many instance types. Each
instance type offers different combinations of CPU,
RAM, storage, and networking capabilities.
• You can configure security groups to control access
to instances (specify allowed ports and source).
• User data enables you to specify a script to run the
first time that an instance launches.
• Only instances that are backed by Amazon EBS can
be stopped.
• You can use Amazon CloudWatch to capture and
review metrics on EC2 instances

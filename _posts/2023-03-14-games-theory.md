### Nash equilibrium. Two-player games

*Nash equilibrium* is a concept in game theory, named after mathematician John Nash, which describes a state in which each player in a game has chosen a strategy that is optimal given the other players' strategies. In other words, it is a state in which no player can benefit by changing their strategy, assuming that the other players' strategies remain the same.

A *two-player zero-sum game* is a game in which there are only two players, and any gain for one player is exactly matched by an equal loss for the other player. In this type of game, the players are in direct competition with each other, and their interests are completely opposed.

Nash equilibrium is a useful tool for predicting the outcomes of strategic interactions between rational individuals or groups.
However, it is important to note that not all games have a Nash equilibrium, and even if they do, it may not be unique. Additionally, in some cases, players may not be able to find or reach a Nash equilibrium due to coordination or cooperation problems.

#### Saddle point

In game theory, a *saddle point* is a specific kind of solution in two-player zero-sum games. To find a saddle point in a game matrix, one needs to look for the smallest maximum value among the row maximums and the largest minimum value among the column minimums. The intersection of the row and column corresponding to these values is the saddle point.

In practical terms, a saddle point represents a unique optimal strategy for both players in a two-player zero-sum game. If both players play their optimal strategy, the outcome will be a Nash equilibrium, meaning that neither player has an incentive to change their strategy given the other player's strategy.

However, it's important to note that not all games have saddle points, and even when they do, the optimal strategy may not always be easy to find. Additionally, saddle points only exist in two-player zero-sum games, and not in other types of games.

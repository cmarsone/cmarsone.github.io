The Dardel system is the most powerful supercomputer in Sweden. It is an HPE Cray EX that is hosted by the PDC Center for High Performance Computing (PDC) at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Dardel is a flagship of the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS) and has been installed in several steps. The CPU partition was deployed in 2021, and the installation of the GPU partition, plus several significant upgrades to the first phase, were completed recently, so now the complete Dardel system is up and running.

To mark this notable occasion, PDC and NAISS invited researchers from the academic, public and private sectors, as well as others who are interested in high-performance computing, to the inauguration of the full Dardel system.

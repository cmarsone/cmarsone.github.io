title: High Performance Computing with mesocenter
---

### The objectives of a mesocenter

- Providing researchers with an efficient computational environment computational resources well-suited to the various needs 
- a software environment designed for code development (compiling, debugging and profiling tools)
- proximity support

### Creating a research-oriented tool

- promoting access to HPC
- stimulating the development of new numerical methods and algorithms offering a place for scalability tests and improvement (needed for GENCI and PRACE access)
